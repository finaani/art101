Against the Current
by Eddson Jose

Against the Current is a game about social anxiety. The player must traverse a never ending crowd of people. The player can choose to move forward (against the crowd) while increasing their feelings of nervousness or the player can choose to interact with people to decrease their nervous feelings.

A person with social anxiety may practice engaging in social interactions to decrease their feelings of nervousness in the long run. If that same person does not practice or avoids social interactions they become more nervous and moving against the crowd becomes more tiresome thus more difficult.
